# Components


First try to find the component you need in the [shadcn library](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs). This is our reference for new components.
If you can't find it there, use one of the components availiable on the components folder:

- [Icon](/docs/components/icon)
- [Map](/docs/components/map)

export default ({ children }) => <DocsLayout>{children}</DocsLayout>
