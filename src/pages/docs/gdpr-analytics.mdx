# GDPR and analytics

When adding analytics or third-party services to a project, we need to make sure these are GDPR-compliant. One simple rule to follow is that if the service sets cookies or gathers data about the user, then the user must consent to its use *beforehand*.

Services such as [Google Analytics](https://analytics.withgoogle.com/), [Crazy Egg](https://www.crazyegg.com/) and [UserReport](https://www.userreport.com/) are not (or not always) GDPR-compliant. Whenever possible, we like to use GDPR-compliant and open source alternatives such as [Plausible](https://plausible.io/).

When we integrate non-compliant services, then we need to make sure that the user gave their consent **before** any third-party script is loaded in the browser.

It is also very important that it is **as easy for the user to consent as to reject** cookies/third-party services. Both options must be accessible with the same number of clicks.

This recipe demonstrates how the consent can be retrieved, taking Google Analytics 4 as an example.

## Setting up @use-cookie-consent/react

`@use-cookie-consent/react` is a package that takes care of storing and handling the user's consent.

To install, run:
```bash
yarn add -E @use-cookie-consent/react
```


Then, to get access to the user's consent from several components, we need to add a provider in `src/pages/_app.tsx`:

```typescript
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';
import { CookieConsentProvider } from '@use-cookie-consent/react'

type PageProps = {
  dehydratedState: unknown;
};

const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps<PageProps>) => {
  return (
    <CookieConsentProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </CookieConsentProvider>
  );
};

export default MyApp;
```

## Getting the user's consent and loading third-party services

In a new component, `src/containers/third-party/index.tsx`, we add the logic that:

- asks the user to consent
- loads the third-party services if and when the user has consented

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import Script from 'next/script';
import { useCookieConsentContext } from '@use-cookie-consent/react';

import Cookies from 'components/cookies';

const GA_TRACKING_ID = 'GOOGLE-TRACKING-ID';

const ThirdParty: React.FC = () => {
  const { consent, acceptCookies, declineAllCookies } = useCookieConsentContext();

  return (
    <>
      {consent.thirdParty === true && (
        <>
          <Script
            id="gtm-script"
            strategy="afterInteractive"
            src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${GA_TRACKING_ID}`}
          />
          <Script id="gtm-config-script" strategy="afterInteractive">
            {`
              window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
              function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
              gtag('js', new Date());
              gtag('config', '${GA_TRACKING_ID}');
            `}
          </Script>
        </>
      )}
      <Cookies
        open={consent.thirdParty === undefined}
        onAccept={() => acceptCookies({ thirdParty: true })}
        onReject={() => declineAllCookies()}
      />
    </>
  );
};

export default ThirdParty;
```

## Tracking events

To start tracking events with Google Analytics, we define some helpers in `src/lib/analytics/ga.ts`:

```typescript
const GA_TRACKING_ID = 'GOOGLE-TRACKING-ID';

/**
 * Log a page view
 */
export const GAPage = (url: string): void => {
  if (window.gtag) {
    window.gtag('config', GA_TRACKING_ID, {
      page_path: url,
    });
  }
};

/**
 * Log an event
 */
export const GAEvent = ({ action, params }): void => {
  if (window.gtag) {
    window.gtag('event', action, params);
  }
};
```

We can then update `src/pages/_app.tsx` again to:

- load our `ThirdParty` component
- track the page views

```typescript
import { useCallback, useEffect } from 'react';
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { CookieConsentProvider } from '@use-cookie-consent/react'

import { GAPage } from 'lib/analytics/ga';

type PageProps = {
  dehydratedState: unknown;
};

const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps<PageProps>) => {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleRouteChangeCompleted = useCallback((url: string) => {
    GAPage(url);
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    router.events.on('routeChangeComplete', handleRouteChangeCompleted);

    return () => {
      router.events.off('routeChangeComplete', handleRouteChangeCompleted);
    };
  }, [router.events, handleRouteChangeCompleted]);

  return (
    <CookieConsentProvider
      useCookieConsentHooksOptions={{
        consentCookieAttributes: { expires: 180 }, // Store the consent for 180 days
      }}
    >
      <ThirdParty />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </CookieConsentProvider>
  );
};

export default MyApp;
```

â€¦ and we're done!

export default ({ children }) => <DocsLayout>{children}</DocsLayout>
